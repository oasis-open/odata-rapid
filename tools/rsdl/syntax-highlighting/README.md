# Syntax Highlighting for RSDL - RAPID Schema Definition Language

RAPID Schema Definition Language (RSDL) is a language to define Web APIs.

RSDL is based on the [RAPID PROfile](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile_(engineering)>) of the [OData](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Data_Protocol) specification. RAPID provides an easy way to envision, create, and consume a Web API that is compatible with the OData Standard and can evolve over time to support more advanced scenarios.
