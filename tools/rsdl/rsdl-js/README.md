# RSDL-to-CSDL Compiler

RAPID Schema Definition Language (RSDL) is a language to define Web APIs.

RSDL is based on the [RAPID Profile](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile_(engineering)>) of the
[OData](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Data_Protocol) specification. RAPID provides an easy way
to envision, create, and consume a Web API that is compatible with the OData Standard and can evolve over time to support more advanced scenarios.

## Installation

Clone or download this repository, go to the `rsdl-js` folder and type

```sh
npm install
```

To install globally type

```sh
npm install -g
```

## Usage

Assuming you installed the package globally and your RSDL file is `MyModel.rsdl`, then

```sh
rsdl2csdl -p myModel.rsdl
```

will create `MyModel.json` next to it.

Just type

```sh
rsdl2csdl -h
```

to get usage hints

```
Usage: rsdl2csdl <options> <source files>
Options:
 -h, --help              show this info
 -p, --pretty            pretty-print JSON result
```

If you installed the script locally, start it via

```sh
node lib/cli.js ...
```

## Development Setup

## TODO

- [x] create grammar
- [x] create listener that produces CSDL
- [x] create CLI
- [x] use test files from ../rapid-cli/rapid.rdm.transformation.tests/data
- [ ] inheritance
- [ ] annotations
- [ ] create error listener for syntactically incorrect "files"
- [ ] log errors from CLI
- [ ] Option `-a` for compiling all files in a folder?
- [ ] Option `-r` for recursive compilation?
- [ ] Update to ANTLR 4.9.x
