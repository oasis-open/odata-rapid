# CSDL Xml Serializer

CSDL has a native in-memory and serialized JSON representation.  The CSDL XmlSerializer saves the in-memory JSON CSDL to XML.

## Installation

## Usage

Assuming you installed the package globally and your JSON CSDL file is `MyModel.json`, then

```sh
csdl2xml myModel.json
```

will create `MyModel.xml` next to it.

Just type

csdl2xml -h
```

to get usage hints
