# Contributing

## Public Participation Invited

This OASIS TC Open Repository ( [odata-rapid](https://github.com/oasis-open/odata-rapid) ) 
is a community public repository that supports participation by anyone, whether affiliated 
with OASIS or not.  Substantive contributions (repository "code") and related feedback is 
invited from all parties, following the common conventions for participation in GitHub public 
repository projects.  Participation is expected to be consistent with the 
[OASIS TC Open Repository Guidelines and Procedures](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-repositories), 
the [LICENSE](https://www.oasis-open.org/sites/www.oasis-open.org/files/Apache-LICENSE-2.0.txt) 
designated for this particular repository (Apache License v 2.0), and the requirement for 
an [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/cla/individual-cla). 
Please see the repository [README](https://github.com/oasis-open/odata-rapid/blob/main/README.md) 
document for other details.

## Governance Distinct from OASIS TC Process

Content accepted as "contributions" to this TC Open Repository, as defined below, are distinct from 
any [Contributions](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr#contributions) made to the 
associated [OASIS Open Data Protocol (OData) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/odata) itself. Participation in the 
associated Technical Committee is governed by the 
[OASIS TC Process](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process),
[IPR Policy](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr), 
and related [policies](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/). This TC Open Repository 
is not subject to the OASIS TC-related policies. TC Open Repository governance is defined by separate 
[participation and contribution guidelines](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/open-repositories) 
as referenced in the 
[OASIS TC Open Repositories Overview](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/).

## Licensing Distinct from OASIS IPR Policy

Because different licenses apply to the OASIS TC's specification work, and this TC Open Repository, 
there is no guarantee that the licensure of specific repository material will be compatible with 
licensing requirements of an implementation of a TC's specification.  Please refer to the 
[LICENSE](https://github.com/oasis-open/odata-rapid/blob/main/LICENSE) file for the terms 
of this material, and to the OASIS IPR Policy for 
[the terms applicable](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr#RF-on-RAND-Mode) 
to the TC's specifications, including any applicable 
[declarations](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/odata/ipr.php).



## Contributions Subject to Individual CLA

Formally, "contribution" to this TC Open Repository refers to content merged into the "Code" repository 
(repository changes represented by code 
[commits](https://github.com/oasis-open/odata-rapid/commits/main)), following the 
GitHub definition of [contributor](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#contributor): 
"someone who has contributed to a project by having a pull request merged but does not have collaborator 
[i.e. direct write] access." Anyone who signs the TC Open Repository 
[Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/cla/individual-cla), 
signifying agreement with the licensing requirement, may contribute substantive content subject to 
evaluation of a GitHub pull request.  The main web page for this repository, as with any GitHub public 
repository, displays a link to a document listing contributions to the repository's default branch 
(filtered by Commits, Additions, and Deletions).

This TC Open Repository, as with GitHub public repositories generally, also accepts public feedback from 
any GitHub user.  Public feedback includes opening issues, authoring and editing comments, participating 
in conversations, making wiki edits, creating repository stars, and making suggestions via pull requests. 
Such feedback does not constitute an OASIS TC Open Repository contribution. Some details are presented 
under "Read permissions" in the table of 
[permission levels for a GitHub organization](https://help.github.com/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/). 
Technical content intended as a substantive contribution (repository "Code") to an TC Open Repository 
is subject to evaluation, and requires a signed Individual CLA.

## Fork-and-Pull Collaboration Model

OASIS TC Open Repositories use the familiar 
[fork-and-pull collaboration model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/#fork--pull) 
supported by GitHub and other distributed version-control systems. Any GitHub user wishing to contribute 
should [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#fork) the repository, make additions or 
other modifications, and then submit a pull request. GitHub pull requests should be accompanied by 
supporting [comments](https://help.github.com/articles/commenting-on-the-diff-of-a-pull-request/) and/or 
[issues](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issues/). Community conversations about pull requests, 
supported by GitHub [notifications](https://help.github.com/articles/about-notifications/), will provide 
the basis for a consensus determination to merge, modify, close, or take other action, as communicated 
by the repository [Maintainers](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/maintainers-guide).
