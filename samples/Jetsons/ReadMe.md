# Jetsons Sample Service

The code in this directory implements a simple sample RAPID service based on the popular 60's tv show The Jetsons.

The sample service is implemented using the [RESTier](https://github.com/OData/RESTier/blob/master/README.md) OData framework.

There are three project directories:

1. Microsoft.Restier.Providers.InMemory -- Provides common utilities for registering per-session or global services
2. Jetsons -- this is the main read-only service hosted on Azure
3. JetsonsRW -- this is a read-write version of the Jetsons service that creates a sandbox in which the user can experiment with making updates to the data through POST/PATCH/DELETE operations.

## Building the Sample Service from the command line

The Sample Service can be built from the command line by downloading the latest [.NET 7.x SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) and running the following command:
