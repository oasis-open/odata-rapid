## OASIS TC Open Repository: odata-rapid

> NOTE: OData Rapid is under construction 

This GitHub public repository was created at the request of the 
[OASIS Open Data Protocol (OData) TC](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/odata/) as an

leadership, intellectual property terms, participation rules, and other matters of governance 
are [separate and distinct](https://github.com/oasis-open/odata-rapid/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#governance-distinct-from-oasis-tc-process)
