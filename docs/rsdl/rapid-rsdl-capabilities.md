# Expressing Capabilities in RAPID Schema Definition Language (RSDL)

RAPID uses a Schema Definition Language ([RSDL](./rsdl-intro)) to describe the structure of a REST service. Developers can be annotate their schema model with [capabilities](./rsdl-abnf#model-capabilities) in order to describe the capabilities of their service.

# Annotating Model Elements

Model elements are the service, operations, types, and properties defined in in an RSDL Schema.

Capabilities applied to model elements determine the set of paths and capabilities implemented by the service. The developer can generate a set of paths and capabilities from the annotated model to explore or further refine the supported functionality.

Capabilities for a model element are specified in curly braces following the model element definition. Omitting a capability within the curly braces means that capability is not supported. If no curly braces follow the model element, a [default set of capabilities](#default-capabilities) is assumed.

## Support for reading data

A top level singleton or single-valued reference property can be annotated with the `READ` capability to show that it supports reading.

```rsdl
service {
  company: Company { READ }
}
```

States that the path `GET /company` is supported.

Applying the `READ` capability to a top-level collection or collection valued reference property states that individual members of the collection can be read using their key value.

```rsdl
service {
  competitors: [Company] { READ }
}

type Company
{
  key stockSymbol: String
  ...
}

```

States that the path `GET /competitors/{stockSymbol}` is supported.

### Read Options

The `READ` capability can be further refined to specify the specific read capabilities that are supported. If no curly braces follow the `READ` capability then a default set of capabilities is assumed. If empty curly braces follow the `READ` capability then the value can be read, but none of the read options are supported.

#### Expand Option

The `expand` option within the `READ` capability specifies that reference properties within the referenced type can be expanded.

```rsdl
service {
  company: Company { READ { expand } }
}
```

The `expand` option alone means that all reference properties within the referenced type can be expanded. So, for example, the user can specify `GET /company?$expand=employees`.

The `expand` option may be followed by a list of individual reference properties that can be expanded.

```rsdl
service {
  company: Company { READ { expand(employees) } }
}
```

Means that only the employees reference property can be expanded.

##### Nested Expand Options

The `expand` option followed by an empty set of parens means that no properties can be expanded.

Collection-valued reference properties can include nested expand [expand](#expand-option), [filter](#filter-option), [orderBy](#orderby-option), [top/skip](#top-and-skip-options) and [count](#count-option) options, as appropriate.

In the example:

```rsdl
service {
  company: Company { READ { expand( employees { top, skip, count, filter, orderby } ) } }
}
```

`top`, `skip`, `count`, `filter`, and `orderby` query options are supported when expanding employees from company:

`GET /company?expand=employees(top=10;skip=1;count=true;filter=lastName eq 'Jetson';orderby=firstName)`

Expand options can be applied to all reference properties not otherwise specified using the `*`

```rsdl
service {
  company: Company { READ { expand( * { top, skip, count, filter, orderby } ) } }
}
```

`top`, `skip`, `count`, `filter`, and `orderby` query options are supported when expanding all reference properties from company.

If no curly braces follow a collection-valued reference property, then top, skip, count, filter, and orderby are all assumed to be supported.

Additionally, if no curly braces follow a reference property or `*`, then it is assumed that `expand` supports nested expands according to the capabilities of each reference property of the target type, recursively.

If the reference property or `*` is suffixed by empty curly braces, then no expand options are supported when expanding the property.

## Listing Collections

A [top level collection](./rsdl-intro#defining-a-top-level-Collection) can be annotated with the `LIST` capability to show that it supports listing members.

```rsdl
service {
  competitors: [Company] { LIST }
}
```

States that the path `GET /competitors` is supported.

Similarly, a collection-valued reference property can be annotated with the same capability:

```rsdl
service {
  company: Company { READ }
  competitors: [Company] { LIST, READ }
}

type Company
{
  key stockSymbol: String
  name: String
  incorporated: Date
  employees: [Employee] { LIST, READ }
}
```

The `LIST` capability on `competitors` means that the path `GET /competitors` is supported.

The `LIST` capability on `employees`, along with the `READ` capability on `competitors`, means that the path `GET /competitors/employees` is supported.

The `LIST` capability on `employees`, together with the `READ` capability on `company`, means that the path `GET /company/{stockSymbol}/employees` is supported.

If there are no curly braces following a top-level collection or collection-valued reference property within a type, it is assumed to support `LIST` and `READ`, as well as `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.

### List Options

The `LIST` capability can be followed by a set of options that specify what capabilities the service supports when enumerating the collection.

LIST options include [expand](#expand-option), [filter](#filter-option), [orderBy](#orderby-option), [top and skip](#top-and-skip-options), and [count](#count-option). If no options are supported, it is assumed that expand, filter, orderby, top, skip, and count are all supported when listing the collection. If an empty curly brace follows the LIST capability, it means that no list options are supported.

#### Filter Option

The `filter` option within the `LIST` capability specifies that a filter can be applied when listing the collection.

```rsdl
service {
  competitors: [Company] { LIST { filter }, READ }
}
```

Specifies that the [`filter`](../rapid-pro-read.md#filtering-results) query option can be used when listing competitors.

##### Filterable capability

Individual properties of the collection type may be annotated with the `filterable` capability to show that they can be used when filtering a collection of that type.

```rsdl
type Company
{
  key stockSymbol: String { filterable }
  name: String { filterable }
  incorporated: Date { filterable }
  employees: [Employee] { LIST { filter }, READ }
}
```

Specifies that filterable collections of companies can be filtered on stockSymbol, name, and incorporated.

The `filterable` capability can include a filter option to specify the filter operators that can be applied when filtering by the property:

```rsdl
  name: String { filterable { stringComp } }
```

Possible values for filter options are as follows:

| Property Type | filter option | supported filter operators                                         |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| any primitive | `none`        | not filterable                                                     |
| any primitive | `eq`          | `eq`                                                               |
| any primitive | `comp`        | `eq`, `gt`, `ge`, `lt`, `le`                                       |
| string        | `string`      | `eq`, `startswith`, `endswith`, `contains`                         |
| string        | `stringComp`  | `eq`, `gt`, `ge`, `lt`, `le`, `startswith`, `endswith`, `contains` |

Properties that do not have a `filterable` capability, or that have a `filterable` capability with no specified filter option, are assumed to be filterable in collections that support filtering using the filter operators appropriate to their type.

#### OrderBy Option

The `orderby` option within the `LIST` capability specifies that an orderby can be applied when listing the collection.

```rsdl
service {
  competitors: [Company] { LIST { filter, orderby }, READ }
}
```

Specifies that the [`orderby`](../rapid-pro-read.md#ordering-results) query option can be used when listing competitors.

##### Orderable capability

Individual properties of the collection type may be annotated with the `orderable` capability to show that they can be used when ordering a collection of that type.

```rsdl
type Company
{
  key stockSymbol: String { orderable }
  name: String { orderable }
  incorporated: Date { orderable }
  employees: [Employee] { LIST { filter, orderby }, READ }
}
```

Orderable collections of `Company` can be ordered on stockSymbol, name, and incorporated.

The `orderable` capability can include the set of orderby options to specify whether the property can be ordered ascending, descending, or both.

```rsdl
  name: String { orderable { asc, desc} }
```

The `name` property can be ordered by ascending (`asc`) or descending (`desc`).

Primitive properties that do not have an `orderable` capability, or that have a `orderable` capability without specifying `asc` or `desc`, are assumed to be orderable in ascending or descending order.

#### Top and Skip Options

The `top` and `skip` option within the `LIST` capability specify that `top` and `skip` [query options](../rapid-pro-read.md#requesting-a-range-of-members) can be used when listing the collection.

```rsdl
service {
  competitors: [Company] { LIST { top, skip }, READ }
}
```

The `top` and `skip` query option can be used when listing competitors.

#### Count Option

The `count` option within the `LIST` capability specify that the [count](../rapid-pro-read.md#requesting-a-range-of-members) query option can be used when listing the collection.

```rsdl
service {
  competitors: [Company] { LIST { count }, READ }
}
```

The `count` query option can be used when listing competitors.

## Support For Modifying Data

Capabilities can be applied to top-level collections and collection-valued reference properties to specify whether they support [`POST`](#create-capability), [`PATCH`](#update-capability), [`PUT`](#replace-capability), or [`DELETE`](#delete-capability) operations.

If no capabilities are applied to a top-level collection, or to a collection-valued reference property, it is assumed to support `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`, as well as `GET`, but not `PUT`.

### Create Support

The `CREATE` capability can be applied to a collection of reference values to state that members can be inserted into the collection.

```rsdl
service {
  competitors: [Company] { CREATE }
}

type Company
{
  key stockSymbol: String
  employees: [Employee] { CREATE }
}
```

States that the paths `POST /competitors` and `POST /competitors/{stockSymbol}/employees` are supported.

#### Create Options

The `CREATE` capability can be followed by the [`expand`](#expand-option) option to specify that the `expand` query option can be applied to the `POST` request in order to include related resources when returning the created item.

```rsdl
service {
  competitors: [Company] { CREATE { expand(employees) } }
}
```

States that the path `POST /competitors?expand=employees` is supported to return the new competitor along with related employees.

### Update Support

The `UPDATE` capability can be applied to a reference-valued property to state that the property is updatable.

```rsdl
service {
  company: Company { UPDATE }
}
```

States that the path `PATCH /company` is supported.

The `UPDATE` capability can also be applied to a collection of reference values to state that individual members of the collection can be updated.

```rsdl
service {
  competitors: [Company] { UPDATE }
}

type Company
{
  key stockSymbol: String
  employees: [Employee] { UPDATE }
}
```

States that the paths `PATCH /competitors/{stockSymbol}` and `PATCH /competitors/{stockSymbol}/employees/{id}` are supported.

### Update Options

The `UPDATE` capability can be followed by the [`expand`](#expand-option) option to specify that the `expand` query option can be applied to the `PATCH` request in order to include related resources when returning the updated item.

```rsdl
service {
  company: Company { UPDATE { expand(employees) } }
}
```

States that the path `PATCH /company?expand=employees` is supported to return the related employees along with the updated competitor.

### Replace Support

The `REPLACE` capability can be applied to a reference-valued property to state that the property can be replaced.

```rsdl
service {
  company: Company { REPLACE }
}
```

States that the path `PUT /company` is supported.

The `REPLACE` capability can be applied to a collection of reference values to state that individual members of the collection can be replaced.

```rsdl
service {
  competitors: [Company] { REPLACE }
}
type Company
{
  key stockSymbol: String
  employees: [Employee] { REPLACE }
}
```

States that the paths States that the path `PUT /competitors/{stockSymbol}` and
`PUT /competitors{stockSymbol}/employees/{id}` are supported.

#### Replace Options

The `REPLACE` capability can be followed by the [`expand`](#expand-option) option to specify that the `expand` query option can be applied the `PUT` request in order to include related resources when returning the replaced item.

```rsdl
service {
  company: Company { REPLACE { expand(employees) } }
}
```

States that the path `PUT /company?expand=employees` is supported to return the related employees along with the competitor.

### Delete Support

The `DELETE` capability can be applied to a reference-valued property to state that the property can be deleted.

```rsdl
service {
  company: Company { DELETE{}} }
}
```

States that the path `DELETE /company` is supported.

The `DELETE` capability can also be applied to a collection of reference values to state that individual members of the collection can be deleted.

```rsdl
service {
  competitors: [Company] { DELETE{} }
}
type Company
{
  key stockSymbol: String
  employees: [Employee] { DELETE{} }
}
```

States that the paths `DELETE /competitors/{stockSymbol}` and `DELETE /competitors/{stockSymbol}/employees/{id}` are supported.

#### Delete options

The `DELETE` capability does not support any delete options and must be followed by empty braces `{}` to denote that no query options are supported.

## Operation Support

Operations that return a single result can be followed by [`expand`](#expand-option) to specify that the `expand` query option can be applied the request in order to include related resources when returning the result.

```rsdl
service {
  topCompany() : Company { expand(employees) }
}
type Company
{
  key stockSymbol: String
  employees: [Employee]
}
```

States that the path `GET /topCompany?expand=employees` is supported to return the related employees along with the top company.

In addition to [`expand`](#expand-option), operations that return a collection can be followed by any of the [`LIST`](#list-options) capability options to specify [`filter`](#filter-option), [`orderby`](#orderby-option), [`top`, `skip`](#top-and-skip-options), and [`count`](#count-option) support.

```rsdl
service {
  topCompanies( num: Integer ) : [Company] { filter, orderby, top, skip, count, expand }
}
```

States that query options `filter`, `orderby`, `top`, `skip`, `count`, and `expand` are all supported when calling `topCompanies`.

## Default Capabilities

Not applying capabilities to a model element means that you support the default capabilities for that element, as defined in the following table:

| Model Element                                                | Default Capabilities               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Top-level collection or collection-valued reference property | LIST, READ, CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE |
| Singleton or single-valued reference property                | READ                               |
