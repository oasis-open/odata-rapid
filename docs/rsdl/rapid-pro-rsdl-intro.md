# Introduction to RAPID Pro schema definition language (RSDL)

<p style="font-size: xxx-large">DRAFT</p>


RAPID Pro schema definition language (RSDL) is language to describe Web APIs.
RSDL is based on a [profile](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile_(engineering)>) of the
[OData](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Data_Protocol) specification with the goal to provide an easy way
to create a Web API that is compatible with OData and can evolve into a more elaborate version.

## Introductory Example

The core description of the "shape" of the API is given by a RSDL document.

Below is a first example of an RSDL file that describes an API of a service that provides data on companies and their employees

```RSDL
type company
{
    @key stockSymbol: string
    name: string
    incorporated: dateTime
    employees: [employee]
}

type employee
{
    @key id: integer
    name : string
    title: string
    employmentType: employmentType
}

enum employmentType { salaried hourly }

service {
    companies: [company]
    employees: [employee]
}
```

With this relatively small API definition, the service can already serve many different requests to create, update, and delete companies and employees and query for them in multiple ways.
Below is a (incomplete) list of URLs that can be used with the service. Let's assume the web service is hosted on http://example.com
