# Introduction to RAPID Schema Definition Language (RSDL)

RAPID Schema Definition Language (RSDL) is a language to define Web APIs.

RSDL is based on the [RAPID Profile](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile_(engineering)>) of the
[OData](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Data_Protocol) specification. RAPID provides an easy way
to envision, create, and consume a Web API that is compatible with the OData Standard and can evolve over time to support more advanced scenarios.

## Introductory Example

RAPID APIs are defined by a schema, which can easily be specified using RSDL.

### Defining a Structured Type

Let's say that we wanted our API to deal with information about a company. We could specify the properties of a company as follows:

```rsdl
type Company
{
  stockSymbol: String
  name: String
  incorporated: Date
}
```

Our company has three properties: a stockSymbol, a name, and the date of incorporation.

A property in RAPID can be an Integer, String, Boolean, DateTime, Date, Double, Decimal, TimeOfDay, Duration built-in types, an [enum type](#defining-an-enum), a [structured type](#defining-a-structured-type), or a collection of any of the former.

### Defining a Service

Now we can create a service that returns information about our company:

```rsdl
service {
  company: Company
}
```

This allows us to make simple requests against our company:

| Request                                                                                                                        | Comment                                      |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| GET [http://rapid-pro.org/company?select=stockSymbol,name](https://jetsons.azurewebsites.net/company?$select=stockSymbol,name) | get the stock symbol and name of the company |
| PATCH http://rapid-pro.org/company <br/> { "name":"Spacely's Space Sprockets" }                                                | update the company name                      |

### Defining a Structured Type Property

Now let's say that we wanted to add employees to our company.

First, we would define the employee type:

```rsdl
type Employee
{
  key id: Integer
  firstName : String
  lastName : String
  title: String
}
```

The id property is identified as a key, meaning that instances of employees within a collection can be referenced by their id.

Now we can add employees to our company:

```rsdl
type Company
{
  stockSymbol: String
  name: String
  incorporated: Date
  employees: [Employee]
}
```

The employees property is a collection of our employee type. Because it is a collection, the type is enclosed in square brackets `[`...`]`.

Now we can get employees for our company:

| Request                                                                                                                                                                        | Comment                                                         |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET [http://rapid-pro.org/company/employees?select=lastName,title](https://jetsons.azurewebsites.net/company/employees?$select=lastName,title)                                 | list the last name and title for all employees for the company  |
| GET [http://rapid-pro.org/company/employees/1?select=lastName,title](https://jetsons.azurewebsites.net/company/employees/1?$select=lastName,title)                             | get the last name and title of the employee with id=1           |
| GET [http://rapid-pro.org/company?select=name&expand=employees(select=lastName)](<https://jetsons.azurewebsites.net/company?$select=name&$expand=employees($select=lastName)>) | get the company name and the last names of all of its employees |
| POST http://rapid-pro.org/company/employees <br/> { "firstName": "Cosmo","lastName": "Spacely","title": "CEO" }                                                                | add a new employee                                              |
| PATCH [http://rapid-pro.org/company/employees/1](https://jetsons.azurewebsites.net/company/employees/1) {"title": "Assistant to the Assistant Regional Manager"}               | change the title of the employee with id=1                      |
| DELETE http://rapid-pro.org/company/employees/1                                                                                                                                | delete the employee with id=1                                   |

### Defining a Top-Level Collection

Our service exposes a single top-level company instance.

We could also add a top-level collection.

For example, we could reuse the same company type to create a collection of companies that are competitors.

```rsdl
service {
  company: Company
  competitors: [Company]
}
```

Because company is now part of a collection, if we want to reference individual companies within the collection we would define a key. In this case, we use stockSymbol as the key:

```rsdl
type Company
{
  key stockSymbol: String
  name: String
  incorporated: Date
  employees: [Employee]
}
```

Now we can request individual companies within the competitors collection:

| Request                                                                                                                                                | Comment                                                                       |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| POST http://rapid-pro.org/competitors <br/> { "stockSymbol":"cgswl", "name":"Cogswell's Cosmic COGs" "incorporated":"2054-10-04T00:00:00Z" }           | create a new competitor                                                       |
| GET [http://rapid-pro.org/competitors?select=name](https://jetsons.azurewebsites.net/competitors?$select=name)                                         | list the names of all of the competitors                                      |
| GET [http://rapid-pro.org/competitors/cgswl?select=name](https://jetsons.azurewebsites.net/competitors/cgswl?$select=name)                             | get the name of the competitor with the stock symbol cgswl                    |
| GET [http://rapid-pro.org/competitors/cgswl/employees?select=lastName](https://jetsons.azurewebsites.net/competitors/cgswl/employees?$select=lastName) | get the last name of employees for the competitor with the stock symbol cgswl |
| DELETE http://rapid-pro.org/competitors/cgswl                                                                                                          | delete the competitor with the stock symbol cgswl                             |

### Defining an Enum

Enumerations allow us to define a string-valued property with a fixed set of values.

Let's say that we wanted to define an employmentType enumeration, with possible values "salaried" and "hourly". We could do so as follows:

```rsdl
enum EmploymentType
{
  salaried
  hourly
}
```

Now we could use that employmentType enum in our employees example:

```rsdl
type Employee
{
  key id: Integer
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
  title: String
  employeeType: EmploymentType
}
```

### Defining a Structured Property without Identity

Our employee has first name and last name properties. We could define a "fullName" type to group those properties together:

```rsdl
type FullName
{
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
}
```

and then use that type in our employee:

```rsdl
type Employee
{
  key id: Integer
  name: FullName
  title: String
}
```

Grouping these properties together keeps them organized and makes them easy to use in various structured types.

### Defining Methods

RAPID supports actions and functions.

#### Actions

An action takes zero or more input parameters and may or may not return a value. Actions may have side effects.

We can define a "youAreFired" action on our company that takes a string parameter "reason":

```rsdl
type Company
{
  key stockSymbol: String
  name: String
  incorporated: Date
  employees: [Employee]
  topEmployees(num: Integer): [Employee]
  action youAreFired(reason: String)
}
```

youreFired has the `action` attribute to show that it is an action and may have side-affects. It does not return a value.

Because actions may have side-affects, they are invoked using POST. Their parameters are passed in the body of the request.

| Request                                                                                     | Comment                                              |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| POST http://rapid-pro.org/company/employees/1/youreFired <br/> { "reason": "Embezzlement" } | invoke the youreFired action on employee with id = 1 |

Actions and functions may also be defined on the service.

```rsdl
service {
  company: Company
  competitors: [Company]
  currentStockPrice(stockSymbol: String): Decimal
}
```

| Request                                                                                                                                  | Comment                               |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| GET [http://rapid-pro.org/currentStockPrice?stockSymbol=cgswl](<https://jetsons.azurewebsites.net/currentStockPrice(stockSymbol=cgswl)>) | get the current stock price for cgswl |

#### Functions

A function takes zero or more input parameters, and returns a value. Functions must not have side effects.

We can define a "topEmployees" function on our company:

```rsdl
type Company
{
  key stockSymbol: String
  name: String
  incorporated: Date
  employees: [Employee]
  topEmployees(num: Integer) : [Employee]
}
```

topEmployees takes a single Integer parameter "num" and returns a collection of employees.

Functions are invoked using a GET request. Function parameters are passed in the URL.

| Request                                                                                                                                 | Comment                            |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| GET [http://rapid-pro.org/company/topEmployees?num=10](<https://jetsons.azurewebsites.net/company/Jetsons.Models.topEmployees(num=10)>) | get the company's top 10 employees |
