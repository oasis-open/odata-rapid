title: RAPID and OpenAPI
---

OpenAPI is an extremely popular specification for documenting a REST API.
Because the RAPID profile builds upon REST, it is natural and encouraged for RAPID services to support OpenAPI.

As the RAPID service description defines a superset of what a service might want to document through OpenAPI,
a [suggested translation]("http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata-openapi/v1.0/odata-openapi-v1.0.html") is defined for translating a RAPID service description to OpenAPI.
