RAPID defines simple REST operations for Create, Update, and Delete.

## Creating a Resource

Resources are added to a collection by submitting a `POST` request to the collection.

| Template    | POST {collection-resource-path}             |
| ----------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Example** | POST http://rapid-pro.org/company/employees |

**Body:**

```json
{
    "firstName": "Elroy",
    "lastName": "Jetson",
    "title": "Intern"
}
```

Payloads sent to the service don't require the `@context` property because the request defines the expected shape of the payload. 
If specified, the `@context` is ignored by the service.

Properties that are nullable or have a default value may be omitted from the `POST` request.

The service returns, at minimum, a `Location` header specifying the URL for the created resource. 
It may also include a payload containing the values of the newly created resource, 
including default or computed values.

## Deep Insert

When creating a new resource, related resources can be created and associated in the same request.

| Template    | POST {collection-resource-path}       |
| ----------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **Example** | POST http://rapid-pro.org/competitors |

**Body:**

```json
{
    "name": "Cogswell's Cosmic COGs",
    "incoporated": "2054-10-4",
    "stockSymbol": "cgswl",
    "employees": [
        {
            "firstName": "Spencer",
            "lastName": "Cogswell",
            "title": "CEO"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Updating a Resource

Resources are updated by submitting a `PATCH` request to the URL identifying the resource.

| Template    | PATCH {single-resource-path}                   |
| ----------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Example** | PATCH http://rapid-pro.org/company/employees/5 |

**Body:**

```json
{
    "title": "Manager"
}
```

The payload for a `PATCH` request need only include the properties that are being updated. 
Properties not specified in the payload are not changed.

## Upserting a Resource

Where the key value is specified by the client, not generated by the server,
a resource can be created by submitting a `PATCH` request to the URL that will identify the resource.

| Template    | PATCH {single-resource-path}                   |
| ----------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Example** | PATCH http://rapid-pro.org/company/employees/5 |

**Body:**

```json
{
    "firstName": "Elroy",
    "lastName": "Jetson",
    "title": "Intern"
}
```

If the resource with the specified URL already exists, it is updated, otherwise a new resource is created.

## Deleting a Resource

Resources are deleted by submitting a `DELETE` request to the URL identifying the resource.

| Template    | DELETE {single-resource-path}                   |
| ----------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Example** | DELETE http://rapid-pro.org/company/employees/2 |
