RAPID-PRO define simple REST operations for Create, Update, and Delete operations on a resource.

# Creating a Resource

Resources are added to a collection by submitting a POST request to the collection.

| Template    | POST {collection-resource-path}             |
| ----------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| **Example** | POST http://rapid-pro.org/company/employees |

**Body:**

```json
{
    "firstName": "Elroy",
    "lastName": "Jetson",
    "title": "Intern"
}
```

Payloads sent to the service don't require the context property because the request defines the expected shape of the payload. 
If specified, the context is ignored by the service.

Properties that are nullable, or have default values, may be omitted from the POST request.

The service returns, at minimum, a location header specifying the URL for the created resource. 
It may also include a payload containing the values of the newly created resource, 
including default or computed values.

# Deep Insert

When creating a new resource, related resources can be created and associated in the same request.

| Template    | POST {collection-resource-path}       |
| ----------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **Example** | POST http://rapid-pro.org/competitors |

**Body:**

```json
{
    "name": "Cogswell's Cosmic COGs",
    "incoporated": "2054-10-4",
    "stockSymbol": "cgswl",
    "employees": [
        {
            "firstName": "Spencer",
            "lastName": "Cogswell",
            "title": "CEO"
        }
    ]
}
```

# Updating a Resource

Resources are updated by submitting a PATCH request to the URL identifying the resource.

| Template    | PATCH {single-resource-path}                   |
| ----------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Example** | PATCH http://rapid-pro.org/company/employees/5 |

**Body:**

```json
{
    "title": "Manager"
}
```

The payload for a PATCH request need only include the properties that are being updated. 
Properties not specified in the payload are not changed.

# Upsert

Where the key value is specified by the client, not generated by the server,
a resource can be created by submitting a PATCH request to the URL that will identify the resource:

| Template    | PATCH {single-resource-path}                   |
| ----------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Example** | PATCH http://rapid-pro.org/company/employees/5 |

**Body:**

```json
{
    "firstName": "Elroy",
    "lastName": "Jetson",
    "title": "Intern"
}
```

If the resource with the specified URL already exists it is updated, otherwise a new resource is created.

# Deleting a Resource

Resources are deleted by submitting a DELETE request to the URL identifying the resource.

| Template    | DELETE {single-resource-path}                   |
| ----------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Example** | DELETE http://rapid-pro.org/company/employees/2 |
